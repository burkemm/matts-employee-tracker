**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I'm able to create, update, and delete employees in an employee tracker. This is useful for projects and knowing who manages what employees.
The user can change managers for employees too.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned about how to create databases and how to use mySQL. I learned how to make a package.json and install the necessary items. Run npm i console-table, 
npm i mysql, npm i mysql2, and npm i inquirer to install the necessary items for the database app to work properly.
